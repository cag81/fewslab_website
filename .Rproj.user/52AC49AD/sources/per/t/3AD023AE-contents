### Teaching Philosophy

Dr. Grady’s teaching interests include a variety of water resources, environmental engineering, and environmental policy courses. Her pedagogy blends active learning and problem-based learning approaches, combining student-centered instruction with real-world problems. These methods emphasize critical thinking and the application of technical knowledge to transdisciplinary topics.

In recent years, she has taught and guest lectured in several courses, including:

- Global Environmental Politics  
- Communicating with Policymakers  
- Global Sustainable Engineering  
- Engineering Environmental Sustainability  
- Water & Wastewater Treatment  
- Introduction to Sustainable Water Resources  
- Introduction to Environmental Engineering

Dr. Grady has organized the Penn State Ethics and Engineering Case Competitions, sponsored by the Rock Ethics Institute. These competitions provided undergraduate students with the opportunity to explore real-world issues at the intersection of engineering and ethics. Participants developed and presented ethical solutions to contemporary challenges in engineering and business. Prizes were awarded to the top three teams.

- **2017 Winners**: William “Louden” Buchanan and Steven Weber  
- **2018 Winners**: Autumn Deitrick and Krina Patel  

While the 2019 competition was not held, interested students should check with Dr. Grady regarding future opportunities.
