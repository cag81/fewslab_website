### Teaching Philosophy

Dr. Grady’s teaching interests include a variety of systems engineering, engineering design, and environmental policy courses. Her pedagogy blends active learning and problem-based learning approaches, combining student-centered instruction with real-world problems. These methods emphasize critical thinking and the application of technical knowledge to transdisciplinary topics.

In recent years, she has taught and guest lectured in several courses, including:

- Global Environmental Politics  
- Communicating with Policymakers  
- Global Sustainable Engineering  
- Engineering Environmental Sustainability  
- Water & Wastewater Treatment  
- Introduction to Sustainable Water Resources  
- Introduction to Environmental Engineering
